# Airfoil Analysis with Python + XFOIL

This project automates aerodynamic analysis of airfoil geometries using **Python** and **XFOIL**.  
It streamlines the process of running simulations, extracting performance data, and visualizing results.

---

## ‚úàÔ∏è Features
- Automates XFOIL runs for multiple airfoil geometries (e.g., NACA series).
- Extracts lift, drag, and moment coefficients across a range of angles of attack.
- Generates comparative plots to evaluate performance metrics.
- Reduces manual simulation time by automating input and output handling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **XFOIL**
- `subprocess` (to call XFOIL)
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- `numpy`  (for data handling)
